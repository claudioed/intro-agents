Requiring the user interface to be a direct reflection of the domain model will force the design of a better domain model.[5]\\nDomain-driven design has influenced other approaches to software development.\\n Thanks to model-driven engineering's model transformation and code generation techniques, the domain model can be used to generate the actual software system that will manage it.[7]\\nCommand Query Responsibility Segregation[edit]\\nCommand Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architectural pattern for separating reading data (a 'query') from writing to data (a 'command'). Domain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:\\nCritics of domain-driven design argue that developers must typically implement a great deal of isolation and encapsulation to maintain the model as a pure and helpful construct.

The fact of the matter is, the mismatch between the model that's in everyone's head and the model you're committing to code is the first thing an aspiring domain modeler should understand.\\n The path to the Form you want to describe with your code is scattered about in the minds of domain experts, the desires of stakeholders, and the requirements of industries in which we're working. My preferred technique for accomplishing this is to provide the dependency to the command method:\\nThe benefit of this approach is that you don't need an inversion of control (IOC) container to create an entity for you.
